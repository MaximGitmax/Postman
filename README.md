# Postman

This repo contains my practical tasks in Postman.

<b>postman_1.postman_collection.json</b> - Send request to the server by GET method with URL params and POST method with params in body in form-data format AND get a response that contains entered values.

<b>postman_2.postman_collection.json</b> - Testing Web-Service by sending request to the server by POST method and get a response (code: 0 - OK, code:1 - ERROR), then creating bug reports in file bug_reports_postman_2

<b>bug_reports_postman_2</b> - bug report for postman_2


You can just look at .json files or deploy them into your Postman app.
