# Postman

This repo contains my practical tasks in Postman. You can import each file into Postman and explore it.

- Postman_1: 

  - <b>postman_1.postman_collection.json</b> - Send request to the server by GET method with URL params and POST method with params in body in form-data and get a response that contains entered values.

- Postman_2:
  - <b>postman_2.postman_collection.json</b> - Testing Web-Service by sending request to the server by POST method and get a response (code: 0 - OK, code:1 - ERROR), then creating bug reports in file bug_reports_postman_2

  - <b>bug_reports_postman_2</b> - bug reports for postman_2.postman_collection.json

- Postman_3:
  - <b>postman_3.postman_collection.json</b> - Writing scripts to test the response from the API. When file was imported to Postman, you can open the tab "Tests" in each request and explore my scripts. Each script has the comments. And don't forget to import environment variables from postman_3.postman_environment.json

  - <b>postman_3.postman_environment.json</b> - environment variables for postman_3.postman_collection.json
